# Changelog

## 0.15.10 (TBA)

### Enhancements
* [FEATURE][adapter] `@miden-sdk/miden-wallet-adapter-miden` now exports a conformance suite — `MIDEN_WALLET_METHODS`, `getSurfaceCases`, `getBehaviorCases`, `runConformance` — that a wallet imports and runs against its own providers. The method list is type-locked to the `MidenWallet` interface in both directions, so adding a method without adding a case, or naming a method the interface does not declare, fails to compile. `getSurfaceCases` needs no connection or state, so it is safe to run against runtime-only injected providers; `getBehaviorCases` needs a live one.
* [FEATURE][repo] `publish-web-sdk.yml` now ships the adopted wallet-adapter, Para and Turnkey packages. They are gated from `scripts/publish-manifest.json` rather than a bespoke script per package, and published in dependency-level order so a dependent never lands before the package it pins. The generalised gate gains a registry probe in `pr` mode, which the per-package scripts lack — without it a partially-failed `next`-channel release could not be retried, because every already-published package would be re-reported as publishable and die on a version conflict, stranding everything after the failure point.
* [FEATURE][repo] The wallet-adapter, Para and Turnkey packages now live in this repository, under `packages/adapter/`, `packages/para/` and `packages/turnkey/`. They already tracked this repo's release line and publish under the `@miden-sdk` scope; moving them here lets them resolve the client and React SDK through the workspace instead of the registry, and puts them on the same OIDC trusted-publishing path as everything else — all eleven previously shipped from a laptop with no provenance attestation. Full git history is preserved.
* [BREAKING][para][turnkey] The six signer packages are renamed to drop the redundant `miden-` prefix, matching `@miden-sdk/react` and `@miden-sdk/vite-plugin`: `@miden-sdk/miden-para` → `@miden-sdk/para`, `@miden-sdk/use-miden-para-react` → `@miden-sdk/para-react`, `@miden-sdk/create-miden-para-react` → `@miden-sdk/create-para-react`, `@miden-sdk/miden-turnkey` → `@miden-sdk/turnkey`, `@miden-sdk/miden-turnkey-react` → `@miden-sdk/turnkey-react`, `@miden-sdk/create-miden-turnkey-react` → `@miden-sdk/create-turnkey-react`. All six now share the repo's version line; the old names are deprecated on npm and point at the new ones. The five `@miden-sdk/miden-wallet-adapter*` names are unchanged.

* [FEATURE][web] Vendor-neutral observability. `ClientOptions.observer` registers a callback the client invokes once per operation with a `MidenObservation` — `op` (the underlying client method name), `outcome` (`"ok"` / `"error"`), and `durationMs`. The SDK never transports an observation: it hands the object to the callback and forgets it. `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` gains no telemetry dependency (direct, peer, or optional) and the module that delivers observations imports nothing and has no egress primitive; both halves are asserted on every CI run by `js/__tests__/no-telemetry-dependency.test.js`, which parses the module and checks it reaches for no global, builds no code at runtime, constructs nothing, and calls nothing but the observer. The observer is invoked synchronously after the operation has already settled and inside a `try`/`catch`, so it can neither fail an operation nor change its timing, ordering, or result. `op` names the wrapped client method rather than the high-level call, so one `client.transactions.send(...)` reports four observations (`executeTransaction`, `proveTransaction`, `submitProvenTransaction`, `applyTransaction`). Registration is process-wide: constructing a second client with an `observer` replaces the first one's, and a mock client — which has no `observer` field of its own on `MockOptions` — still reports to an observer registered elsewhere in the process, except from the three sync methods it overrides.

```ts
const client = await MidenClient.create({
  rpcUrl: "testnet",
  observer: (o) => console.log(o.op, o.outcome, Math.round(o.durationMs)),
});
```

* [FEATURE][web] `ClientOptions.observeSensitive` opts an observation into a high-fidelity `sensitive` channel carrying the verbatim `error.message` and stack — unclassified and unredacted — populated only when an operation fails. It defaults to off, and when off the `sensitive` key is **absent** from the observation object rather than `undefined` or `{}`, so `"sensitive" in observation` distinguishes "not enabled" from "enabled with nothing to report". Only the literal boolean `true` enables it, so a truthy `"true"` from an env var or a JSON round-trip reads as off; the resolved value is sealed onto the client with `Object.defineProperty` as non-writable and non-configurable, so no later assignment can turn disclosure on for a client built without it; and enabling it logs a one-time console warning. `MidenObservationSensitive.accountId` is declared but not currently populated — consumers should not depend on it being present.
* [FEATURE][telemetry-sentry] New package `@miden-sdk/telemetry-sentry`. `createSentryObserver({ client, minDurationMs?, includeSensitive? })` returns an observer for `ClientOptions.observer` that reports operations to a Sentry client you own and configure. Sentry is not a dependency of the package, not even a peer — the binding is typed structurally against `captureMessage`, so the consumer keeps control of the version, the DSN, and `Sentry.init`. `minDurationMs` defaults to `Infinity`, i.e. failures only, so an omitted option cannot silently bill a Sentry quota for the SDK's whole successful call volume; failures are always forwarded. A throwing or unreachable Sentry client takes its own report with it and nothing else.

```ts
const client = await MidenClient.create({
  rpcUrl: "testnet",
  observer: createSentryObserver({ client: Sentry, minDurationMs: 5_000 }),
});
```

* [FEATURE][telemetry-otel] New package `@miden-sdk/telemetry-otel`. `createOtelObserver({ tracer, includeSensitive? })` returns an observer that records each operation as a span named `miden.<op>` on a tracer you own. OpenTelemetry is not a dependency, not even a peer — the binding is typed structurally against `startSpan` and inlines the one constant it needs (`SpanStatusCode.ERROR` as `2`), which also avoids a second `@opentelemetry/api` in the tree quietly registering its own global provider. Spans are reconstructed rather than live, since the SDK reports an operation only once it has finished: the span is backdated to `endTime - durationMs` and ended explicitly at `endTime` (epoch milliseconds), keeping the span's own interval in agreement with its `miden.duration_ms` attribute. A duration that is not finite and non-negative is recorded as an instant with no duration attribute instead of a garbage timestamp.

```ts
const client = await MidenClient.create({
  rpcUrl: "testnet",
  observer: createOtelObserver({ tracer: trace.getTracer("my-app") }),
});
```

* [FEATURE][telemetry-sentry,telemetry-otel] Both bindings require the sensitive channel to be opted into a second time via `includeSensitive: true`, and drop it by default even when the SDK supplies it — so enabling `observeSensitive` on the client does not by itself disclose anything through a binding. Both read the channel's fields by name rather than enumerating them, so a field a later SDK version adds cannot start flowing to a backend before someone decides it should. Neither binding throws from its observer; both throw a `TypeError` from the factory when the client or tracer is missing, because an observer cannot report its own misconfiguration and one built around a missing sink would discard every observation while looking exactly like a working one.

### Changes

* [CHANGE][ci] `scripts/check-react-sdk-sync.js` now verifies the `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` pin of **every** package that builds against it, not just `@miden-sdk/react` and the wallet example. The packages are discovered from the workspace rather than listed in the script, so a new package is covered from the moment it exists rather than when someone remembers to add it — `@miden-sdk/telemetry-sentry` and `@miden-sdk/telemetry-otel` shipped pinned to the core with nothing verifying them. Discovery keys off the build-time `workspace:*` dev dependency rather than off the pin being checked, so deleting a peer range fails the check instead of removing the package from it. The check also covers the wallet example's other first-party dependencies, which caught `@miden-sdk/react` there sitting two minors stale at `^0.15.8`; it is now in step with the rest.

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] `sendPrivateNote` now relays the note's on-chain commitment block as the transport hint when the sender's store already has an inclusion proof, falling back to the current sync height only for the prompt-relay-before-commit path. Previously the sync-height hint overshot the commitment when relay was deferred until after the sender had synced past the note, causing silent non-delivery on fast chains ([#262](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/262)).

## 0.15.9 (2026-08-04)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][web] Added `NoteScript.burn()`, `NoteScript.mint()`, and `NoteScript.pswap()`, exposing the remaining well-known note scripts (the faucet burn/mint pair plus partial-fill swap) so the static constructors now mirror every `StandardNote` variant alongside the existing `p2id()` / `p2ide()` / `swap()`. The standard BURN note script root is now reachable from TypeScript as `NoteScript.burn().root().toHex()`. ([#256](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/256))

```ts
const burnScriptRoot = NoteScript.burn().root().toHex();
```

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] `client.notes.sendPrivate(...)` now relays a block hint (the sender's current sync height) through the transport layer, so an already-synced recipient locates the note's on-chain commitment deterministically instead of relying on a narrow fixed lookback window that silently dropped it. Relay promptly after submitting the note's transaction so the hint stays at or before the note's commitment. No API change. ([web-sdk#258](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/258))
* [FIX][web] Bundled `miden-client` bumped to 0.15.5. Upstream note-transport fixes reaching the web SDK: a transport delivery that collides with a note a local transaction is consuming no longer wedges `sync()` (it is skipped and the cursor advances), and transport deliveries are now validated on receipt — entries whose details don't match the header's commitment, or whose tag was never requested, are dropped. `prepare_transaction` also no longer panics on an already-consumed input note that carries no metadata. ([miden-client 0.15.5](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/releases/tag/v0.15.5))

## 0.15.8 (2026-07-22)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][web] `BasicFungibleFaucetComponent.fromAccountStorage(accountStorage)` reads faucet metadata directly from an account's storage, covering faucets whose account shape makes `fromAccount` fail (e.g. AggLayer faucets). Available on both the browser and Node.js bindings (closes [#243](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/243), [web-sdk#244](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/244)).

```ts
const faucetMeta = BasicFungibleFaucetComponent.fromAccountStorage(account.storage());
faucetMeta.symbol().toString(); // "DAG"
```

* [FEATURE][web] `FungibleAsset.fromVaultEntry(key, value)` reconstructs a fungible asset from the word pair stored under it in an account vault — the outputs of `FungibleAsset.vaultKey()` (faucet id + callback flag) and `FungibleAsset.intoWord()` (the value word holding the amount) — so `FungibleAsset.fromVaultEntry(a.vaultKey(), a.intoWord())` round-trips an asset read from vault data, callback flag included. `FungibleAsset.fromVaultKey(key, amount)` is a convenience for when you hold the key word plus a scalar `bigint` amount rather than the value word, and `FungibleAsset.vaultKey()` exposes the key word for the round trip. (closes [#246](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/246))

## 0.15.7 (2026-07-20)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][web] Manual transaction lifecycle on `client.transactions` — `executeRequest(account, request)` returns a staged handle you advance with `.prove({ prover? })` → `.submit()` → `.apply()`, exposing the stages that `submit()` runs in one call so each can be benchmarked and error-handled independently. Each stage carries its own context, so nothing is re-threaded between calls. A proof produced on a detached client can be submitted with `client.transactions.submitProven(proof, result)` (closes [#233](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/233)).

```ts
const executed = await client.transactions.executeRequest(wallet, request);
const proven = await executed.prove();
const submitted = await proven.submit();
await submitted.apply();
```

* [FEATURE][web] `FungibleAsset.callbacks()` and `FungibleAsset.withCallbacks(flag)` expose the asset's `AssetCallbackFlag` (`Disabled` / `Enabled`) — the vault-key bit that decides whether the issuing faucet's callbacks run when the asset is added to an account or note. The constructor always yields `Disabled`; `withCallbacks` returns a copy carrying the given flag. The flag is part of the asset's vault key, so it must match the flag the issuing faucet applies. (closes [#239](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/239))

```ts
const asset = new FungibleAsset(faucetId, 10n);
asset.callbacks(); // AssetCallbackFlag.Disabled
const enabled = asset.withCallbacks(AssetCallbackFlag.Enabled);
```

## 0.15.6 (2026-07-17)

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Bundled `miden-client` bumped to 0.15.4. Upstream fixes reaching the web SDK: public-account sync no longer discards the client's own just-committed transaction as `Superseded` (which could permanently wedge a sole-writer account); transaction-submission failures now report the node's actual cause instead of a misclassified error; `ConsumedExternal` notes retain their metadata, so they stay findable by note ID after consumption; sync responses slightly above the node's 4 MiB payload budget no longer fail to decode. ([miden-client 0.15.4](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/releases/tag/v0.15.4))
* [FIX][web] Creating a transaction no longer registers a note tag per output note. Previously each created note leaked one `tags` row in IndexedDB (cleanup only ever covered input notes); a store migration prunes the leaked tags, keeping those still needed by inclusion-pending input notes. Mirrors the client-side SQLite migration. (client [0xMiden/rust-sdk#2323](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2323))

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][web] `InputNoteRecord.isInclusionPending()` and `OutputNoteRecord.isInclusionPending()` — `true` while the note's on-chain inclusion is still unsettled (input notes: `Expected` / `Unverified`; output notes: `ExpectedFull` / `ExpectedPartial`), i.e. while sync is the mechanism that can advance the record. (client [0xMiden/rust-sdk#2323](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2323))
* [FEATURE][web] `AccountComponent.createNetworkAuth(allowedNoteScriptRoots, allowedTxScriptRoots?)` builds the auth component for a network account — a public account the node auto-consumes network notes against. The note-script allowlist (roots from `NoteScript.root()`) must be non-empty; transaction scripts are forbidden unless allowlisted via the optional second argument. Readback: `Account.isNetworkAccount()` and `Account.networkNoteAllowlist()`. ([#236](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/236))

```ts
const auth = AccountComponent.createNetworkAuth([noteScript.root()]);
const { account } = new AccountBuilder(seed)
  .storageMode(AccountStorageMode.public())
  .withComponent(counterComponent)
  .withAuthComponent(auth)
  .build();
```

## 0.15.5 (2026-07-08)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][web] `client.transactions.createNetworkNote(...)`, `Note.withAttachments/attachments/isNetworkNote`, `NetworkAccountTarget`, and standalone `buildNetworkNote` — create custom-script notes that target a public network account. ([#230](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/230))
* [FEATURE][react] `useCreateNetworkNote` — build + submit a custom-script network note. ([#230](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/230))

## 0.15.4 (2026-06-29)

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] `account.storage().getItem(slot)` / `getMapItem(...)` results (`StorageResult`) now forward `toU64s()`. The result is typed as a `Word` and already forwards `toFelts()` / `toHex()` / `toBigInt()`, but `toU64s()` was missing, so reading raw u64 elements off a storage value (e.g. `getItem(slot).toU64s()`) threw `toU64s is not a function` at runtime. This broke the OpenZeppelin multisig client's `AccountInspector` (run on every multisig-account `load`), and thus every guardian transaction. ([#194](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/194))

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][web] `BasicFungibleFaucetComponent` now exposes the full token metadata of a fungible-faucet account: `tokenName()`, `tokenSupply()` (the amount minted so far, as a `Felt`), `description()`, `logoUri()`, and `externalLink()` — the optional descriptive fields return `undefined` when unset. These read the same on-chain `FungibleFaucet` component that already backed `symbol()` / `decimals()` / `maxSupply()`, so they work for both basic and network-style faucet accounts. In the 0.15 protocol the basic-vs-network distinction is a function of account configuration, not a separate component type, so a dedicated `NetworkFungibleFaucet` binding is unnecessary. ([#162](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/162))

```ts
const faucet = BasicFungibleFaucetComponent.fromAccount(account);
faucet.tokenName();               // "DAG Token"
faucet.tokenSupply().toString();  // "0"
faucet.description();             // string | undefined
```

* [FEATURE][web,react] AggLayer bridge-out (B2AGG) note support. `client.transactions.bridge({ account, bridgeAccount, token, amount, destinationNetwork, destinationAddress })` bridges a fungible asset out to another network — emitting a single public B2AGG (Bridge-to-AggLayer) note that the bridge account consumes, burning the asset so it can be claimed at the destination Ethereum address on the AggLayer-assigned `destinationNetwork`. The lower-level builders are also exposed: `Note.createB2AggNote(sender, bridgeAccount, assets, destinationNetwork, destinationAddress)` and `client.newB2AggTransactionRequest(...)`. A new `EthAddress` class carries the 20-byte destination address (`EthAddress.fromHex("0x…")` / `EthAddress.fromBytes(bytes)`, with `toHex()` / `toBytes()`). The `@miden-sdk/react` `useBridge()` hook wraps the build-and-submit flow: `bridge({ from, bridgeAccount, assetId, amount, destinationNetwork, destinationAddress })`. Builds on the `miden-agglayer` re-export already present in the bundled `miden-client` — no new dependency. (closes [#173](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/173))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `client.transactions.batch({ account, operations })` to `MidenClient` for atomic multi-tx batches against a single account. Operations are discriminated by `kind` (`"send" | "mint" | "consume" | "swap" | "execute" | "custom"`) and reuse the same options shape as their singular counterparts. Returns `{ blockNumber }`. Companion `submitBatch(account, requests, options?)` is the lower-level escape hatch for pre-built `TransactionRequest`s. Wraps the underlying WASM `submitNewTransactionBatch` so consumers don't have to call `.serialize()` themselves. ([web-sdk#31](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/31), client [#2109](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2109))

## 0.15.3 (2026-06-25)

### Fixes

* [FIX][web,react] The `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` **Node entry** (resolved via the `node` export condition — Next.js / Remix server builds, Vitest, and any bundler that prefers `node`) now re-exports the full public class surface, matching the browser entry. It previously shipped a hand-curated subset, so importing a class the subset omitted — e.g. `BasicFungibleFaucetComponent`, `TransactionRequest`, `InputNoteRecord`, `NoteAttachmentScheme`, `Poseidon2` — or using a `@miden-sdk/react` hook that imports one (`useAssetMetadata`, `useCompile`) — failed under Node resolution with `"'X' is not exported from '@miden-sdk/miden-sdk'"`, even though the type declarations advertised it. The JS-layer helpers `CompilerResource` and `getWasmOrThrow` are now exported on Node too. The Node re-export list is generated from the native module and checked in CI, so it stays in lockstep with the surface. ([#206](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/206))

## 0.15.2 (2026-06-22)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][web] `TransactionRequest.extendAdviceMap(adviceMap)` merges advice entries into an already-built request and returns a new request (last-write-wins on key collisions), and `TransactionRequest.adviceMap()` returns a copy of the request's advice map. This lets a signer/guardian flow inject advice (e.g. a signature) that only becomes available *after* the request object is constructed, without going back through the builder. ([#203](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/203), closes [#202](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/202))
* [FEATURE][web,react] PSWAP order-lineage tracking. The client persists a *lineage* per partially-fillable swap order — the chain of remainder notes a PSWAP leaves behind as it is filled round by round — keyed by a stable `orderId`. A new `pswap` resource on `MidenClient` exposes `pswap.lineages()`, `pswap.lineagesFor(creator)`, and `pswap.lineage(orderId)`, returning `PswapLineageRecord`s — `remainingOffered()` / `remainingRequested()` (the amounts still unfilled on the current tip), `currentDepth()`, `currentTipNoteId()`, and `state()` (`Active` / `FullyFilled` / `Reclaimed`) — plus `pswap.cancelByOrder(orderId)`, which reclaims the unfilled offered asset on the order's current tip (refused on a `FullyFilled` / `Reclaimed` order). Four React hooks expose the reads + cancel: `usePswapLineages`, `usePswapLineagesFor`, `usePswapLineage`, and `usePswapCancelByOrder`. ([#176](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/176), companion: [0xMiden/miden-client#2231](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2231))

### Changes

* [behavior][web] `applyTransaction(...)` now persists through the high-level client apply path, so registered transaction observers (e.g. PSWAP lineage tracking) fire when a transaction is applied — previously the split prove/submit/apply pipeline persisted the update without firing any. For transactions unrelated to a tracked order the observer pass is a no-op. ([#176](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/176))

## 0.15.1 (2026-06-19)

### Changes

* [web,react] Bumped the bundled `miden-client` to `0.15.2`. Notes imported from the note transport layer now honor a sender-provided block hint (`after_block_num`) when present, falling back to the 20-block lookback window otherwise. The bump also makes miden-client's PSWAP chain-tracking APIs (`pswap_lineages`, `build_pswap_cancel_by_order`, …) and `send_private_note_with_block_hint` available in the bundled core for later exposure, and re-exports `miden-agglayer`. No web/React API changes. (companion: [0xMiden/miden-client#2231](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2231), [0xMiden/miden-client#2262](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/2262), [0xMiden/miden-client#2253](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/2253))

## 0.15.0 (2026-06-12)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][web,react] The 0.14.x line's mobile/MT proving surface is available on the 0.15 series (forward-ported from `main`): `TransactionProver.newCallbackProver(jsFn)` (route prove to a native iOS/Android plugin; wire format matches `RemoteTransactionProver`), `ClientOptions.useWorker?: boolean` / `MidenConfig.useWorker` (opt out of the Web Worker shim — required for callback provers, whose closure cannot cross the worker boundary), `MidenClient._withInnerWebClient(fn)` with the depth-tracked re-entrancy fix, the multi-threaded WASM build at the `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk/mt` + `/mt/lazy` (and `@miden-sdk/react/mt` + `/mt/lazy`) subpaths, and the `miden-mobile-prover` C-ABI crate — now built against the 0.15 protocol, so its `TransactionInputs`/`ProvenTransaction` wire format requires a matching 0.15 SDK (native binaries built from 0.14 do not interoperate). ([#149](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/149), [#152](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/152), [#134](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/134))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `BlockHeader.feeFaucetId()` — the account ID of the fungible faucet whose assets pay transaction verification fees, read from the block's on-chain fee parameters. This is the 0.15 spelling of the 0.14 line's `BlockHeader.nativeAssetId()` (the underlying protocol field was renamed `native_asset_id` → `fee_faucet_id`); consumers discovering the fee/native asset per network should migrate to the new name.

* [FEATURE][rust,cli,web] Added `get_network_note_status` to `NodeRpcClient` trait for querying the processing status of notes submitted to the network (pending, nullifier-inflight, discarded, nullifier-committed), along with attempt count and error details. Exposed as `miden-client network-note-status <note_id>` CLI command and `RpcClient.getNetworkNoteStatus()` in the web client. ([#1981](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1981))
* [FEATURE][web,react] Added partial-swap (PSWAP) support: `transactions.pswapCreate / pswapConsume / pswapCancel` on `MidenClient` (and matching `preview()` operations) plus three React hooks `usePswapCreate`, `usePswapConsume`, `usePswapCancel`. PSWAP notes can be filled by multiple consumers; each fill emits a payback note to the creator and, on a partial fill, a remainder PSWAP note carrying the unfilled amount. ([#159](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/159)).
* [FEATURE][web] `RpcClient.getNotesById(...)` results expose the note's attachments via `FetchedNote.attachments`. On the 0.15 surface the node returns attachment content for both public and private fetched notes, so this is populated even when the note body itself is private. ([#172](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/172), companion: [0xMiden/miden-client#2214](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2214))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `NoteAttachment.toWords()` and `InputNoteRecord.attachments()` to read a note's attachment payload back out. On the 0.15 surface the attachment words live on the note record (not on `NoteMetadata`), so these invert `NoteAttachment.fromWord(scheme, word)` / `fromWords(scheme, words)`: `record.attachments()[0].toWords()` yields the `Word`s the attachment was built from. ([#172](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/172), companion: [0xMiden/miden-client#2214](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2214))

### Changes

* [BREAKING][param][web] `RpcClient.syncNotes(blockFrom, blockTo, noteTags)` — `blockTo` is now required, and `NoteSyncInfo.chainTip()` was removed (upstream RPC no longer returns it; use `client.syncState()`). ([#157](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/157))
* [BREAKING][behavior][web] `newFaucet(...)` accounts are now built on `FungibleTokenMetadata` + `TokenPolicyManager`; `BasicFungibleFaucetComponent.fromAccount(...)` reads the new metadata slot, so faucets minted by prior SDK versions can't be introspected through it. ([#157](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/157))
* [BREAKING][api][web,react] Account code mutability was removed (it no longer exists in protocol 0.15, where mutability is component-driven). `newWallet(...)` and `importPublicAccountFromSeed(...)` no longer take a `mutable` flag, and the React `useCreateWallet` / `useImportAccount` / `useSessionAccount` hooks dropped their `mutable` option. `accounts.create({ type })` no longer accepts the wallet/contract mutability values, and the `AccountType` const now exposes only `FungibleFaucet` / `NonFungibleFaucet` (a wallet is the default, a contract is any `create()` call that passes `components`). ([#171](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/171))
* [BREAKING][api][web,react] Migrated `miden-client-web` and `miden-idxdb-store` to the miden-client 0.15 protocol surface. User-visible changes: `AccountStorageMode.network()` was removed (the 0.15 chain has no separate network-account flag — the `"network"` value is no longer a valid `StorageMode`); the `AccountType` enum (previously `{ FungibleFaucet, NonFungibleFaucet, RegularAccountImmutableCode, RegularAccountUpdatableCode }`) narrowed to `{ Private, Public }` (the faucet / regular and updatable / immutable distinctions moved off the on-chain id, so `AccountId.isFaucet()` / `.isNetwork()` / `.isRegularAccount()` were removed from `AccountId` — faucet detection now lives on `Account` as `Account.isFaucet()` / `Account.isRegularAccount()`, derived from the account's component interface — while `Account.isNetwork()` / `Account.isUpdatable()` and the `AccountStorageMode.network()` constructor were removed outright); `Felt` and `Word` constructors now throw on inputs at or beyond the field modulus instead of asserting; `RpcClient.getNoteScriptByRoot(...)` returns `NoteScript | undefined` instead of throwing on unknown roots; `InputNoteRecord.id()` returns `NoteId | undefined` for partial / metadata-less notes; the `NoteAttachmentKind { Word, Array }` dispatch and per-variant `NoteAttachment.newWord` / `.newArray` / `.asWord` / `.asArray` accessors plus the `NoteMetadata.attachment()` getter were removed — attachments are always word-vector-shaped on the new surface (`NoteAttachment.fromWord(scheme, word)` / `fromWords(scheme, words)`); `RpcClient.getAccountProof(...)` keeps the same JS signature but is wired onto the new `get_account(GetAccountRequest...)` upstream API; `FetchedNote` exposes `noteId` / `metadata` directly (the synthetic `header` getter was removed — a `NoteHeader` can no longer be reconstructed from header-shaped fields alone for private notes). React hooks: `useCreateWallet({ storageMode })` and `useCreateFaucet({ storageMode })` drop the `"network"` storage-mode option to match the new surface. `MidenClient.newFaucet(...)` is rebuilt on the 0.15 `FungibleFaucet` component plus a `TokenPolicyManager` that registers `AllowAll` mint and burn policies (transfer policies are intentionally omitted so minted assets carry no callback flag); `non_fungible = true` still fails fast, as non-fungible faucets remain unsupported. `WebClient.importNoteFile(...)` (the resource-layer `notes.import(...)`) now resolves to a hex `string` — the note-id hex, or the details-commitment hex for a details-only file — rather than a `NoteId` object; pass it to `NoteId.fromHex(...)` if a `NoteId` instance is required. `NoteAttachmentScheme.asU32()` was removed (the scheme is now u16-backed). On `idxdb-store`'s `JsStateSyncUpdate`, the `committedNoteIds` field was renamed `committedNoteTagSources` and now carries details-commitment hex rather than note-id hex. ([#172](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/172), companion: [0xMiden/miden-client#2214](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2214))
* [CHANGE][web] `miden-client` and `miden-client-sqlite-store` are now consumed from crates.io at the final `0.15.0` release instead of a `next`-branch snapshot, resolving `miden-protocol` / `miden-standards` to `0.15.3`. Inherited upstream behavior fixes include paginated draining of private note transport responses, a durable relay outbox for `sendPrivateNote`, and MMR response verification during sync. ([#171](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/171), upstream: [miden-client v0.15.0](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/releases/tag/v0.15.0))
* [CHANGE][web] WASM client errors now carry a stable, machine-readable `code` property for the `ClientError` variants JS callers branch on (`code_from_error` in `crates/web-client/src/lib.rs`), currently `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND_ON_CHAIN` and `ACCOUNT_ALREADY_TRACKED`. This lets consumers detect specific errors without matching on the (changeable) message string. The worker shim already forwards `code`, so it survives both the direct and Web Worker dispatch paths.

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] `AssetVault.getBalance(faucetId)` and `FungibleAssetDelta.amount(faucetId)` now match fungible assets by faucet id regardless of the asset's `AssetCallbackFlag`, so balances and deltas of callback-bearing assets (e.g. agglayer / B2AGG) are reported instead of silently reading as zero / absent. ([#171](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/171))
* [FIX][web] **Direct-path (no-worker) client calls are serialized again.** The `main`→`next` unification (#177) dropped the `_serializeWasmCall` chain from the proxy fallback methods (`getAccount`, `getAccounts`, `getTransactions`, …), the five transaction methods (`executeTransaction`, `proveTransaction`, `applyTransaction`, `submitNewTransaction`, `submitNewTransactionWithProver`) and the three sync methods (`syncState`, `syncChain`, `syncNoteTransport`) — every direct-path call ran raw on the WASM client, which holds its internal `RefCell` across the call's awaits. Two overlapping calls panicked with `RefCell already borrowed`, **poisoning the WASM instance**: later calls throw `Unreachable code should not be executed`, and in-flight promises can stay pending forever. Consumers on `useWorker: false` (Capacitor/WKWebView apps, callback-prover hosts — e.g. miden-wallet on mobile, where the front-end's balance polling overlaps wallet-creation syncs) hit this deterministically at boot. All direct-path calls now route through the serialization chain exactly as on `main` and `0.14.x`; `SYNC_METHODS` stay raw-bound by design. Found chasing the mobile leg of [#180](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/180); covered by a burst-concurrency regression test that hangs/panics on the unfixed build.
* [FIX][web] **`proveTransaction(result, prover)` with an explicit prover works on a bare `WebClient`.** Proving with a supplied prover is a pure computation over the `TransactionResult` and touches no client state, but the binding still demanded an initialized client and threw `Client not initialized` when `createClient()` had never run. Prover-only hosts rely on the bare-client pattern — e.g. a `chrome.offscreen` document that initializes a rayon pool in its own WASM instance and proves transactions shipped over from an extension service worker. The explicit-prover path now proves directly (and no longer holds the inner-client lock for the duration of the prove); only the default-prover fallback requires an initialized client. Part of the [#180](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/180) investigation.
* [FIX][web] **A failed method-worker `INIT` no longer hangs every subsequent call forever.** Worker-forwarded methods await the wrapper's `ready` promise, but `ready` only ever *resolved* — an INIT failure (e.g. `createClient`'s eager genesis fetch hitting an unreachable or version-mismatched RPC endpoint) was posted without a `requestId`, matched no pending request, and was dropped, leaving `ready` pending and every method call awaiting it indefinitely with no error. `ready` now rejects with the underlying worker error, so queued and future calls fail loudly with the real cause. This was the wallet leg of [#180](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/180): an extension offscreen document constructed a bare worker-shim client, its INIT defaulted to the testnet endpoint, the 0.15 client got version-rejected by the 0.14 node, and the prove call hung silently for minutes.
* [FIX][react] `MidenProvider` no longer crashes the consumer tree on the `/lazy` entries when a `prover` is configured. The default prover was resolved in a render-time `useMemo`, constructing WASM objects (`TransactionProver`) before the module had initialized — on the lazy entries (no import-time top-level await) this threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '__wbindgen_malloc')` into the nearest error boundary at first render. The prover now resolves once the client is ready. Latent on alphas ≤ .4, where the react `/lazy` build accidentally bundled the eager SDK; exposed by the variant-rewrite fix in 0.15.0-alpha.5. ([#179](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/179))
* [FIX][web] **Mock-client proving now uses the multi-threaded pool.** The worker shim's `INIT_MOCK` path never called `initThreadPool` inside the method worker's WASM instance (unlike the real `INIT` path), so every prove on a mock client — including the integration suite — silently ran single-threaded even on the `/mt` build with a cross-origin-isolated page. `numThreads` is now plumbed through `INIT_MOCK` exactly like `INIT`; a mock mint prove drops from ~23s to ~5s on a 10-core machine. The gap predates 0.15 (reproduced on `0.14.11`). Investigation notes are in [#180](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/180).
* [FIX][react] `readNoteAttachment(record)` decodes attachment payloads again. It reads `record.attachments()[0].toWords()` and flattens the words back into the `bigint[]` packed by `createNoteAttachment` (an all-zero placeholder still decodes to `null`). It had regressed to always returning `null` during the 0.15 migration. ([#172](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/172))
* [FIX][web] IndexedDB input notes are now keyed by their details commitment instead of their note id, matching the SQLite store. A partial (metadata-less) note that is later completed with its note id now updates the same row instead of creating a duplicate. ([#172](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/172), companion: [0xMiden/miden-client#2214](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2214))
* [FIX][web] `miden-idxdb-store` now preserves the fungible-asset `AssetCallbackFlag` when replaying a public-account vault delta during sync. Dropping it made the recomputed vault root diverge from the transaction kernel's (a `ConflictingRoots` error) for callback-bearing assets (e.g. agglayer / B2AGG). Mirrors the SQLite-store fix in [0xMiden/miden-client#2225](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2225). ([#172](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/172))
* [FIX][web] `AccountVaultDelta.addedFungibleAssets()` / `removedFungibleAssets()` now preserve a fungible asset's `AssetCallbackFlag` when rebuilding it from a vault-delta entry, instead of dropping it. The flag is part of the asset's vault-key and value encoding, so callback-bearing assets (e.g. agglayer-minted) were reported without their flag; ordinary assets use the disabled flag where preserving it is a no-op. Companion to the `miden-idxdb-store` sync fix above; mirrors [0xMiden/miden-client#2225](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2225). ([#174](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/174))
* [FIX][react] **`MidenProvider` no longer errors out on a fresh wallet when used with `MidenFiSignerProvider`.** When a signer supplies `accountConfig.importAccountId`, `initializeSignerAccount` (`packages/react-sdk/src/utils/signerAccount.ts`) takes a fast path that calls `client.importAccountById(...)`. For a brand-new wallet the account isn't registered on-chain yet, so the call rejects (`miden-client`'s `ClientError::AccountNotFoundOnChain`). The fast path previously rethrew everything except an "already being tracked" message, so this surfaced as an init error and `MidenProvider` rendered its `errorComponent` instead of children — making the whole dApp unusable. That's a catch-22: registering the account on-chain requires building a first transaction, which requires a working dApp. The fast path now tolerates a fresh, not-yet-registered account (detected via the typed `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND_ON_CHAIN` error `code` rather than message text), still calls `syncState()`, and returns the account ID, so the provider becomes ready; genuine errors (e.g. real network failures) still propagate. The local client keeps no record of the account until it is registered on-chain and a subsequent `importAccountById(...)` (e.g. on a later provider initialization) succeeds — `syncState()` only refreshes already-tracked accounts, so it does not import the account by ID. Until then `useAccount(accountId)` returns `null`, which is the correct fresh state. Reported in `0xMiden/wallet-adapter#86`. ([#166](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/166))

## 0.14.11 (2026-06-09)

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] **`JsAccountUpdate` / `JsStorageMapEntry` / `JsStorageSlot` / `JsVaultAsset` no longer crash under Next.js 16.2 dev-mode console patches.** These four wasm-bindgen structs were declared with `#[wasm_bindgen(inspectable)]`, which made the JS bridge auto-emit a `toJSON()` method that reads every `pub` field through a WASM round-trip (`wasm.__wbg_get_<class>_<field>(this.__wbg_ptr)`). Next.js 16.2's dev-mode `clientFileLogger.log` path runs every non-primitive `console.*` argument through `safe-stable-stringify`, which invokes `toJSON()` automatically — firing 11 WASM getter calls per `console.log(update)`. If the underlying pointer had been freed or another WASM call was in flight, the resulting `"null pointer passed to rust"` trap propagated out of the user's `console.log` call site and crashed the caller (originally surfaced by the Lumina team). Dropping `inspectable` on these four structs (none of the other `inspectable` usages in the SDK have public fields, so they were never affected) skips the auto-generated `toJSON()`; `JSON.stringify` and `safe-stable-stringify` now fall back to `{}` (the wasm-bindgen wrapper has no own enumerable data — it's all behind the `__wbg_ptr`). Field access via the named getters is unchanged. Fixes [`miden-client#2183`](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/2183).
* [FIX][web] Fixed `_withInnerWebClient` re-entrant deadlock. Calling any proxied async wasm method on the `inner` client inside the callback — `inner.getInputNote(...)`, `inner.executeTransaction(...)`, `inner.submitProvenTransaction(...)`, `inner.applyTransaction(...)`, etc. — enqueued onto the same `_serializeWasmCall` chain that `_withInnerWebClient` itself had already claimed for the callback, so the inner call would wait for the outer to settle while the outer awaited the inner — classic re-entrant-lock deadlock with no timeout. `_serializeWasmCall` now runs its callback inline when `_withInnerLockDepth > 0` (set/cleared by `_withInnerWebClient` around `await fn(inner)`), so inner calls "borrow" the already-held chain slot instead of trying to re-acquire it; external callers still queue behind the outer slot. This was the load-bearing bug behind the Miden Wallet's `proveLocallyViaOffscreen` consume path hanging indefinitely with local proving enabled on Chrome MV3 (`generateTransaction:consume` reached "acquired tx lock; calling midenClient dispatch" then never logged another marker), which surfaced to users as a "cannot reach the miden node" connectivity banner via downstream `withWasmClientLock` timeouts in the SW's `SyncManager`. SAFETY CONTRACT: re-entrancy assumes the caller holds an external mutex preventing concurrent access via other code paths during `fn` — the wallet's own `withWasmClientLock` discipline satisfies this. See the docstring on `_withInnerWebClient` for details.

## 0.14.10 (2026-05-19)

### Changes

* [CHORE][web] Bumped `miden-client` to `0.14.9` and `miden-vm` crates to `0.22.4`.

## 0.14.9 (2026-05-13)

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] Added `TransactionProver.newCallbackProver(jsFn)` — a JS-callable prover variant whose `prove()` dispatches to a `Function` returning `Promise<Uint8Array>`. Wire format matches `RemoteTransactionProver` (`tx_inputs.to_bytes()` in, `ProvenTransaction::read_from_bytes(..)` out), so a JS-side bridge (e.g. a Capacitor / Tauri / Electron native-prover plugin) slots in behind the existing dispatcher unchanged ([#149](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/149)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `ClientOptions.useWorker?: boolean` (default `true`) — opt out of the WebClient's Web Worker shim. The shim serialises the prover via `TransactionProver.serialize()` (format `"local"` / `"remote|{endpoint}"`), which has no encoding for the callback variant — the closure is silently dropped and the worker spawns its own in-process WASM prover. Setting `useWorker: false` skips the shim so the JS function reaches `wasmWebClient.proveTransactionWithProver(...)` with the closure intact. Required for any consumer passing a `newCallbackProver` ([#149](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/149)).
* [FEATURE][react] Added `MidenConfig.useWorker?: boolean` — mirrors the new `ClientOptions.useWorker` on the React `<MidenProvider>`, plumbed through to both `WebClient.createClient` and `WebClient.createClientWithExternalKeystore` ([#149](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/149)).

## 0.14.6 (TBA)

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] **Optional multi-threaded WASM proving via dual-build subpaths.** The package now ships TWO WASM artifacts: a single-threaded build at the default subpaths (`@miden-sdk/miden-sdk`, `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk/lazy`) that loads in any browser context, and a multi-threaded build at the new `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk/mt` and `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk/mt/lazy` subpaths that uses wasm-bindgen-rayon for ~3–5× faster proving on cross-origin-isolated pages. Default (ST) behavior is unchanged from v0.14.2 — existing consumers keep working in non-COI contexts with no migration needed. Consumers who want the speedup opt in by importing the `/mt` subpath; they're then responsible for running on a page with `SharedArrayBuffer` + `crossOriginIsolated` (COOP=`same-origin` + COEP=`require-corp` HTTP headers, or the equivalent in a Chrome extension manifest). The MT build re-exports `initThreadPool(n)` which consumers must `await` once before any prove, sized to `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`. PR CI builds ST only via the `MIDEN_FAST_BUILD` flag for ~15-min validation; release CI builds both for the published artifact.
* [FEATURE][web] Added `MidenClient._withInnerWebClient(fn)` escape hatch that runs `fn` with exclusive access to the proxied JS WebClient. Lets framework wrappers split the bundled prove pipeline — for example, dispatching the prove step to a `chrome.offscreen` document or a Web Worker while keeping execute / submit / apply on the main `MidenClient` — without re-implementing the resource-based surface from scratch. The callback runs inside `_serializeWasmCall`, so the WASM RefCell is held for the duration of `fn` and concurrent SDK calls queue safely. Marked private (`_` prefix) and may iterate; pin the SDK version if you depend on it.
* [FEATURE][web] Added `"custom"` operation to `preview()` so users can dry-run any pre-built `TransactionRequest`, not just send/mint/consume/swap ([#2052](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2052)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][react] Fixed `useConsume({ notes: [hexString] })` crashing with `null pointer passed to rust`. Surfaced when consuming notes against accounts built with `withNoAuthComponent()` ([#138](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/138)).
* [FIX][react] Fixed `useMultiSend` crashing with `null pointer passed to rust` whenever any recipient used `NoteType.Private`. The `NoteArray` constructor was moving each output's `Note` handle, leaving it unusable for the post-commit `sendPrivateNote` delivery loop ([#138](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/pull/138)).
* [FIX][react] Fixed `transactionId` (and `txId`) in hook return values being `"[object Object]"` instead of a hex string. `useTransaction`, `useConsume`, `useMint`, `useSwap`, `useSend`, and `useMultiSend` were calling `.toString()` on the WASM `TransactionId` — which has no `toString` binding and so fell through to `Object.prototype.toString`. Switched all six hooks to `.toHex()`, the actual exposed method. The unit-test mock used to mirror the bug (its `.toString()` returned the hex), masking the regression; the mock now matches real WASM behavior so a future regression would fail the suite ([#83](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/issues/83)).

### Chores

* [CHORE][ci] Auto-cut a GitHub release when a `patch release`-labeled PR merges to `main`. Mirrors the existing `next`-branch flow: once the release publishes, `publish-web-sdk.yml` ships every package whose version actually changed to the `latest` dist-tag with provenance.

## 0.14.2 (2026-04-15)

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] Added `compile.noteScript({ code, libraries? })` to `MidenClient`, filling the gap left on the resource-based surface for note-script compilation. Mirrors the existing `compile.txScript` shape ([#2044](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2044)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exported the `CompilerResource` class so framework wrappers (e.g. React hooks) can instantiate the compile surface over a `WasmWebClient` proxy without wrapping the full `MidenClient`. The third constructor argument is now optional ([#2044](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2044)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Fixed `syncState` deterministically failing with `mmr peaks are invalid: number of one bits in leaves is N which does not equal peak length M` after importing a private note whose inclusion block pre-dates the wallet's current sync height. `get_and_store_authenticated_block` was overwriting the correct historical peaks (written by `applyStateSync`) with peaks from the caller's current `PartialMmr` forest, so subsequent reads at the same block hit the `InvalidPeaks` validation. The IndexedDB `insertBlockHeader` now uses add-if-not-exists semantics, matching the SQLite store's `INSERT OR IGNORE` in `insert_block_header_tx` ([#2039](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2039)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed WASM worker loading under webpack 5 / Next.js consumers. v0.14.1's single classic worker rewrote `import.meta.url` → `self.location.href` (needed for Safari/WKWebView cold-start performance), which webpack's asset tracer cannot follow — consumers hit a 404 on `miden_client_web.wasm` and the SDK silently fell back to a main-thread mode that hung on `sync()`. The SDK now ships BOTH variants (`web-client-methods-worker.js` classic for Safari, `web-client-methods-worker.module.js` ES module for webpack/Vite/Parcel) and `WebClient` picks at runtime via UA detection, configurable via the new `WebClient.workerMode` (`"auto"` / `"module"` / `"classic"`) static. No consumer config changes needed for auto ([#2046](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/2046)).

## 0.14.1 (2026-04-14)

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Fixed `syncState` failure ("inconsistent partial mmr: tracked leaf at position N has no value in nodes") caused by skipping authentication node collection for blocks already tracked from the MMR delta during large catch-up syncs. Authentication nodes are now always collected for note-relevant blocks regardless of prior tracking state. ([#1997](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1997)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed `transactions.send({ returnNote: true })` throwing `expected instance of NoteArray`. The JS wrapper was still building `OutputNoteArray` after the WASM binding for `withOwnOutputNotes` switched to `NoteArray` ([#2011](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/2011)).

## 0.14.0 (2026-04-07)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][web] Added `StorageView` JS wrapper over WASM `AccountStorage`. `account.storage()` now returns a `StorageView` that makes `getItem()` work intuitively for both Value and StorageMap slots. WASM primitives are unchanged; the raw `AccountStorage` is accessible via `.raw` ([#1955](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1955)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `wordToBigInt()` utility export for losslessly converting a `Word`'s first felt to a `BigInt`. `StorageResult.toString()` is BigInt-backed, and `valueOf()` returns a JS number for values fitting in `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and throws `RangeError` for larger u64 values — use `.toBigInt()` for exact access ([#1955](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1955)).
* [FEATURE][web] WebClient now automatically syncs state before account creation when the client has never been synced, preventing a slow full-chain scan on the next sync (#1704).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `getAccountProof` method to the web client's `RpcClient`, allowing lightweight retrieval of account header, storage slot values, and code via a single RPC call. Refactored the `NodeRpcClient::get_account_proof` signature to allow requesting just private account proofs ([#1794](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1794), [#1814](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1814)).
* [BREAKING][removal][web] Removed `addAccountSecretKeyToWebStore`, `getAccountAuthByPubKeyCommitment`, `getPublicKeyCommitmentsOfAccount`, and `getAccountByKeyCommitment` from `WebClient`. Use the new `client.keystore` sub-object instead (e.g. `client.keystore.insert()`, `client.keystore.get()`, `client.keystore.getCommitments()`, `client.keystore.getAccountId()` + `client.getAccount()`). ([#1947](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1947)).

### Changes

* [BREAKING][arch][web] Replaced the `WebClient` class with a new `MidenClient` resource-based API as the primary web SDK entry point. `WebClient` is still available as `WasmWebClient` for low-level access but is no longer part of the public API. All documentation has been updated to use `MidenClient`. Migration: replace `WebClient.createClient(rpcUrl, noteTransportUrl, seed, storeName)` with `MidenClient.create({ rpcUrl, noteTransportUrl, seed, storeName })`, and replace direct method calls (e.g. `client.newWallet(...)`, `client.submitNewTransaction(...)`, `client.getAccounts()`) with resource methods (e.g. `client.accounts.create()`, `client.transactions.send(...)`, `client.accounts.list()`). ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1762)).
* [BREAKING][type][web] `AccountId.fromHex()` now returns `Result` (throws on invalid hex) instead of silently panicking via `unwrap()`. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1762)).
* [BREAKING][type][web] `AuthSecretKey.getRpoFalcon512SecretKeyAsFelts()` and `getEcdsaK256KeccakSecretKeyAsFelts()` now return `Result<Vec<Felt>, JsValue>` instead of panicking on key type mismatch ([#1833](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1833)).

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] New `MidenClient` class with resource-based API (`client.accounts`, `client.transactions`, `client.notes`, `client.tags`, `client.settings`). Provides high-level transaction helpers (`send`, `mint`, `consume`, `swap`, `consumeAll`), transaction dry-runs via `preview()`, confirmation polling via `waitFor()`, and flexible account/note references that accept hex strings, bech32 strings, or WASM objects interchangeably (`AccountRef`, `NoteInput` types). Factory methods: `MidenClient.create()`, `MidenClient.createTestnet()`, `MidenClient.createMock()`. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `TransactionId.fromHex()` static constructor for creating transaction IDs from hex strings. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] Added standalone tree-shakeable note utilities (`createP2IDNote`, `createP2IDENote`, `buildSwapTag`) usable without a client instance. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] SDK ergonomics: `accounts.getOrImport(ref)` convenience method, `accounts.import()` accepts full `AccountRef`, `transactions.send()` return type changed to `SendResult` with optional `returnNote`, notes API simplified (`listAvailable` returns `InputNoteRecord[]`, `consume` accepts `Note` objects), `MidenClient.create()` accepts rpcUrl/proverUrl shorthands.
* [BREAKING][FEATURE][web] Custom contract support: `accounts.create()` with `ImmutableContract`/`MutableContract` types, new `client.compile` resource (`compile.component()`, `compile.txScript()` with `"dynamic"`/`"static"` linking), and `transactions.execute({ account, script, foreignAccounts? })` for custom script execution with FPI. `transactions.send()` return type changed. ([#1828](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1828))
* [FEATURE][web] Account import improvements: `accounts.getOrImport(ref)` convenience method, and `accounts.import()` now accepts full `AccountRef` (string, `AccountId`, `Account`, `AccountHeader`) in addition to `{ file }` and `{ seed }` forms. ([#1828](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1828))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `AccountId.fromPrefixSuffix(prefix, suffix)` constructor for building an `AccountId` from its two felt components, useful when prefix/suffix are stored separately in storage maps. ([#1889](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1889))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `TransactionRequestBuilder.withExpirationDelta()` for expiring manual transaction requests ([#1904](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1904))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `accounts.insert({ account, overwrite? })` to `MidenClient` for inserting pre-built `Account` objects into the local store. Enables external signer integrations that build accounts via `AccountBuilder` with custom auth commitments ([#1922](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1922)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `executeProgram` (view call) to the JS side, allowing local execution of a transaction script against an account and inspection of the 16-element stack output without submitting to the network. Added `AdviceInputs` constructor and reverse `From` conversions. ([#1859](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/1859))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `client.keystore` sub-object API for managing secret keys. Methods: `insert(accountId, secretKey)`, `get(pubKeyCommitment)`, `remove(pubKeyCommitment)`, `getCommitments(accountId)`, `getAccountId(pubKeyCommitment)`. Also available on `MidenClient` as a resource (`client.keystore`). ([#1947](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1947))

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Replaced `.unwrap()` panics with proper `Result` returns in `MerklePath.computeRoot()`, `NoteExecutionHint.fromParts()`, `NoteExecutionHint.canBeConsumed()`, `NoteStorage` constructor, and `TransactionStatus.discarded()` WASM bindings ([#1870](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1870)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed the error `TypeError: parameter 1 is not of type 'ArrayBuffer'` when re-initializing a client with an imported database. `Uint8Array` fields (e.g. the client version setting) were exported as plain arrays and not restored to `Uint8Array` on import, causing `TextDecoder.decode()` to fail. Export now tags `Uint8Array` values for correct round-trip. ([#1952](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1952))

## 0.13.4 (2026-03-23)

* [FIX][rust,web] Fixed storage map slots with duplicate roots losing their entries after a store round-trip, which corrupted the storage commitment ([#1915](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1915)).

## 0.13.3 (2026-03-16)

* [FIX][rust,web] Fixed `sync_state()` invoking the external signer (e.g. wallet extension) during note consumability checks, causing repeated confirmation popups on every sync cycle. `NoteScreener` no longer attaches the `TransactionAuthenticator` when trial-executing consume transactions; accounts requiring auth now return `ConsumableWithAuthorization` instead ([#1905](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1905)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed `PrematureCommitError` crash during `syncState()` by moving all IndexedDB writes into a single Dexie transaction instead of spawning competing inner transactions ([#1876](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1876)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `getAccountProof` in the `RpcClient`, accepting optional `AccountStorageRequirements` and block number parameters to fetch specific storage maps without full account reconstruction ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1917)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `syncStorageMaps` in the `RpcClient` for paginated retrieval of large storage maps ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1917)).

## 0.13.2 (2026-02-26)

* [FIX][web] Added missing `attachment()` getter to `NoteMetadata` WASM binding ([#1810](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1810)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed transaction execution failures after reopening a browser extension by always persisting MMR authentication nodes during sync, even for blocks with no relevant notes. Previously, closing and reopening the extension lost in-memory MMR state and the store was missing nodes needed for Merkle authentication paths. Also surfaces a distinct `PartialBlockchainNodeNotFound` error instead of a confusing deserialization crash when nodes are missing ([#1789](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1789)).

## 0.13.1 (2026-02-13)

* [FEATURE][web] Added `setupLogging(level)` and `logLevel` parameter on `createClient` to route Rust tracing output to the browser console with configurable verbosity ([#1669](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1669)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added 3-layer concurrency safety for WASM access: in-tab async lock, cross-tab IndexedDB lock, and auto-sync on cross-tab state changes ([#1784](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1784)).
